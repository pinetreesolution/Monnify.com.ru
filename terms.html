financial institution, acquirer or other third party arising from a transaction, whether or not
previously remitted to the User;</li>
<li>any claim brought against TeamApt arising from any aspect of this Agreement (including but not

</p>

<p>The User agrees that if a fraudulent activity is associated with the operation of its accounts,
TeamApt shall have the right to apply restrictions to such account and report to appropriate law

</div>
<div>
<h3>Chargebacks</h3>
<p>In certain circumstances, card issuers, card schemes and/or other financial institutions may require
repayment in respect of a transaction previously settled and/or remitted to a user, notwithstanding that
authorisation may have been obtained from the card issuer and/or other financial institution (such
circumstances being a <b>"Chargeback"</b>).</p>
<p>The User acknowledges and agrees that under all applicable rules, regulations and operating guidelines
issued by card schemes, financial institutions, the Central Bank of Nigeria and TeamApt relating to
cards, transactions, other payment methods and processing of data, the User may be required to reimburse
TeamApt for Chargebacks in circumstances where User has accepted payment in respect of the relevant
transaction.</p>
<p>All Chargebacks shall correspond to the whole or part of the settlement value of the original transaction
or, at an amount equivalent to the original settlement currency at the rate of exchange quoted for
settlement purposes on the day the Chargeback is processed.</p>
<p>Where a Chargeback occurs, TeamApt shall immediately be entitled to debit the User’s position with
its Settlement Bank and/or make a deduction from any remittance and/or invoice due to the User to
recover:/p>
<ul class="unordered">
<li>the full amount of the relevant Chargeback; and</li>
<li>any other costs, expenses, liabilities or fines which may be incurred as a result of or in connection
with such Chargeback ("<b>Chargeback Costs</b>").</li>
</ul>
<p>A Chargeback represents an immediate liability from the User to TeamApt. Where the full amount of
any Chargeback and/or any Chargeback Costs is not debited by TeamApt from the User’s bank account
or deducted from any remittance or invoiced, then TeamApt shall be entitled to otherwise recover
from the User by any means the full amount of such Chargeback and Chargeback Costs (or the balance
thereof, as the case may be).</p>
<p>TeamApt shall not be obliged to investigate the validity of any Chargeback by any card issuer,
card scheme or other financial institution, whose decision shall be final and binding in respect of any
Chargeback.</p>
<p>As Chargebacks may arise a considerable period after the date of the relevant transaction, the User
acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding any termination of this relationship for any reason,
TeamApt shall remain entitled to recover Chargebacks and Chargeback Costs (and, where relevant,
from any entity who has provided TeamApt with a guarantee or security relating to the User’s
obligations under this relationship) in respect of all Chargebacks that occur in relation to transactions
effected during the term thereof.</p>
<p>TeamApt reserves the right to immediately pass on to and recover from the User any fines incurred
and/or impose further charges on the User and/or terminate the relationship forthwith if TeamApt
considers that the total value of refunds and/or Chargebacks is unreasonable. TeamApt can recover
fines from the User in the same way as Chargebacks and in any event they represent an immediate liability
from the User to TeamApt.</p>
<p>The User agrees that it bears the responsibility to prove TeamApt’s satisfaction (or that of the
relevant card issuer or other financial institution) that the debit of a customer's or cardholder's
account was authorised by such customer or cardholder and that value was given to the customer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Set Off</h3>
<p>TeamApt is authorized to instruct the User’s settlement bank (or any other bank) to combine or
consolidate all or any of the User’s accounts with the settlement bank (or any other bank) and set off or
transfer any sum(s) standing to the credit of any one or more of such accounts in or towards the
satisfaction of the User’s settlement liabilities via the use of Monnify including any fees/fines imposed
on TeamApt due to any breach of this Agreement by the User or any sums wrongfully settled into the
User’s settlement account.</p>
<p>TeamApt is entitled to defer any settlement or any other sum due to the User to the extent that
TeamApt considers necessary or appropriate to protect its ability to recover the fees and/or the
sums or any other liability (actual or anticipated) of the User in connection with this Agreement. </p>
<p>If TeamApt has reasonable suspicion that a transaction may be fraudulent or involve any illegal
activity, TeamApt may suspend the processing of that transaction and any connected, transaction, or
withhold settlement until the satisfactory completion of any investigation. The User shall not be entitled
to any interest or other compensation whatsoever in respect of suspension or delay in receiving the
affected payment. TeamApt reserves the right to refund the money back to the cardholders/customers.
</p>
<p>The exercise by TeamApt of any of its rights under this clause shall be without prejudice to any
other rights or remedies to which TeamApt is otherwise entitled (by operation of law, contract, or
otherwise).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Payouts</h3>
<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, TeamApt will send to your designated bank or card
settlement account (“Bank Account”) all amounts settled and due to you from your transactions, minus our
fees, any reversals, invalidated payments, Chargebacks, Refunds or other amounts that you owe to

you agree that we may debit your Bank Account for the applicable amounts, and/or set-off the applicable
amounts against future Payouts. Upon our request, you agree to provide us with all necessary bank account
and related information and grant us permission to debit amounts due from your Bank Account.</p>

Dashboard to reflect settlement. Information regarding your transactions that are processed and settled
using Monnify (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to your Monnify Dashboard.
While we will provide Transaction History in your Monnify Dashboard, you are solely responsible for
compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Monnify

Transaction History or other records in a manner consistent with your record retention obligations.</p>

funds from card transactions processed through us is on your Monnify Dashboard. We reserve the right to
change your Payout Schedule, suspend payouts to your Bank Account or initiate a reversal should we deem it
necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or Refunds, or other
suspicious activity associated with your use of Monnify, or if required by law, a lawful requirement of a
regulatory authority or court order.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Handling of the User’s Funds</h3>

Payouts and the timing of such Payouts.
</p>
<p>You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement
funds held by TeamApt pending settlement and Payout to your Bank Account.</p>
<p>Settlement funds will be held in a deposit account pending Payouts to you in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. We may periodically make available to you information about pending settlements yet to be

<p>Your authorisations will remain valid and be of full effect until your Monnift user account is closed or
terminated.</p>

services, through which you may opt to open a wallet and warehouse funds in your wallet to perform
transactions. </p>

would not be responsible for the funds in your wallet.</p>
<p>You understand that the relevant deposit money bank shall be responsible for responding to all enquiries
and providing support in connection with the funds in your wallet.</p>
<p>You understand that TeamApt may in its sole discretion, decide to appoint another deposit money
bank to provide wallets in connection with the Service and in furtherance of this, you hereby authorize
TeamApt to transfer the funds in your wallet to the successor deposit money bank with notice to
you. </p>
<p>You hereby authorize TeamApt to instruct the relevant deposit bank that holds the funds in your
wallet to place a restriction on the funds in your wallet if there is reasonable suspicion of fraud in
connection with your user account, if there is an erroneous transaction or if you breach any provision of
this Agreement.</p>
<p>In addition to any other general lien or similar right to which TeamApt may be entitled by law,
you hereby confirm that TeamApt may at any time and without notice to you, instruct the relevant
deposit money bank that holds the funds in your wallet to combine or consolidate all or any of your
wallets and set off or transfer any sum(s) standing to the credit of any one or more of such wallets in or
towards the satisfaction of your liabilities to TeamApt on any other account or in any other
respect, whether such liabilities be contingent, primary or collateral, several or joint. You hereby waive
any right of confidentiality whether arising under common law or statute or in any other manner whatsoever
and irrevocably agree that you shall not argue to the contrary before any court of law, tribunal,
administrative authority, or any other body acting in any judicial or quasi-judicial capacity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Reserves</h3>
<p>In our sole discretion, we may with notice to you, place a reserve on a portion of your Payouts by
holding for a certain period such portion (Reserve).</p>
<p>If we take such steps, we will provide you with the terms of the Reserve which may include the percentage
of your Payouts to be held back, period of time and any other such restriction that TeamApt may
deem necessary. Where such terms are changed, we will notify you. </p>
<p>You agree that you will remain liable for all obligations related to your transactions even after the
release of any Reserve. In addition, we may require you to keep your Bank Account available for any open
settlements, Chargebacks and other adjustments.</p>
<p>To secure your performance of this Agreement, you grant TeamApt a legal claim to the funds held in
the Reserve as a lien or security interest for amounts payable by you.</p>
<p>TeamApt shall be entitled to apply the Reserve to cover any Chargeback or Refund that may arise
including any fees/fines imposed on TeamApt due to any breach of this Agreement by the User.</p>
<p>If the Chargebacks and/or the refunds are higher than the Reserve, the User shall immediately make
available the balance sum required to fulfill the Chargebacks or refunds liabilities.</p>
<p>TeamApt may require that the Reserve provided by the User be supplemented or replaced by any other
form of security acceptable to TeamApt at any time. </p>

bills and bonds), bank guarantee or insurance guarantee or any other guarantee or indemnity.
TeamApt reserves the right to unilaterally call for an increase to the level of security held. </p>
<p>TeamApt may require that any security provided be supplemented or replaced at any time.</p>

settlement sums due to the User as may be determined by TeamApt to cover Chargeback risk, refund
risk or any potential loss, damages, penalties, cost that may be incurred by User for a period of one
hundred and eighty days (180) Business Days. In the event that such retained amount is not sufficient to

TeamApt indemnified in this respect. </p>

<div>
<h3> Webhook Processing</h3>
<ol class="ordered">
<li>You are required to secure your webhook by using a combination of the following approaches:
<ul class="unordered">
<li>
<b>Transaction Hash Validation:</b> This is applicable by default on your transaction notification webhook. A hash of some properties in the request payload is computed, and you can validate this on your server by computing the same hash and comparing outputs.
</li>
<li>
<b>IP Whitelisting:</b> To prevent requests from unauthorized origins, you can whitelist Monnify’s IP address and only honor requests from this IP address. Webhook notifications from Monnify will come from the following IP address - 35.242.133.146
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
When a notification is sent to your server, we expect to receive a 200 HTTP Status Code. When we get this, we assume the notification has been successfully received. If any other response code is received or if the request times out, the request will be resent a maximum of 10 times within a five-minute period between each resend, after which a webhook request will no longer be made.
</li>
<li>When processing webhook notifications from us, you are required to keep track of all notifications you have received. When a new notification is received, you are required to always check to confirm that the notification has not been already processed before giving value so as not to give double value to your customers. A resend of already processed notifications can happen if we do not get a 200 HTTP Status code, or in the case of a request time out.</li>

<h3>DATA PROCESSING PROVISIONS</h3>
<p>To the extent that a Party acts a data processor ("Processor") on behalf the other Party acting as a data
controller ("Controller") in respect of any Personal Data, the Processor shall ensure that</p>
<ol class="ordered">
<li>unless required to do otherwise by applicable Data Protection Laws, it shall (and shall take steps to
ensure each person acting under its authority shall) process the Personal Data only for the purpose of
the Service;</li>
<li> persons authorised by the Processor to process the Personal Data have committed themselves to

<li>if Data Protection Laws require it, to process Personal Data other than for the purpose of the
Service, it shall notify the Controller of any such requirement before processing the Personal Data
(unless applicable laws prohibit such information on important grounds of public interest);</li>
<li>it informs the Controller of any addition, replacement or other changes of Sub-processors and provide
the Controller with the opportunity to reasonably object to such changes on legitimate grounds. The
Controller acknowledges that these Sub-processors may be essential to the provision of the Service and
that objecting to the use of a Sub-processor may prevent the Processor from offering the Services to the
Controller. The Processor will enter into a written Agreement with the Sub-processor imposing on the
Sub-processor obligations comparable to those imposed on the Processor under this Agreement, including
appropriate data security measures. In case the Sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection
obligations under such written Agreement with the Processor, that Processor will remain liable towards
Controller for the performance of the Sub-processor’s obligations under such Agreement. By way of this
Agreement, the Controller provides general written authorization to the Processor to engage
Sub-processors as necessary to perform the Service. </li>
<li>taking into account the nature of the processing, it shall assist the Controller by appropriate
Security Measures (at the Controller’s sole expense), insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of
the Customer's obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights laid down in
Data Protection Laws;</li>
<li>it shall implement and maintain adequate Security Measures in relation to the processing of Personal
Data by the Processor, and taking into account the nature of the processing;</li>
<li>at the choice of the Controller, it shall delete or return all the Personal Data to the Controller
upon the termination or expiry of the Agreement, and delete existing copies unless applicable
laws/regulations require storage of the Personal Data;</li>
<li>it will contribute to audits or inspections by making available to the Controller upon request audit
reports which the Controller must treat confidentially. The Processor will respond to a written security
questionnaire submitted to it by the Controller provided that the Controller will not exercise this
right more than once per year;</li>
<li>in respect of any Security Incident, the Processor shall, without undue delay notify the Controller of
the Security Incident; and provide the Controller with details of the Security Incident;</li>
<li>all transfers by the Processor of Personal Data to countries outside Nigeria shall (to the extent
required under Data Protection Laws) be effected by way of such legally enforceable mechanism(s) for
transfers of personal data as may be permitted under Data Protection Laws from time to time which may
include the standard contractual clauses; and </li>
<li>maintain complete and up to date records of processing activities carried out on the Controller's
behalf as required by the Data Protection Laws.</li>
</ol>
<p>To the extent that the Processor processes any Personal Data on the Controller’s behalf when performing
its obligations under this Agreement, the Controller shall:</p>
<ol class="ordered">
<li>ensure that it is entitled to lawfully transfer the relevant Personal Data to the Processor so that
the Processor may lawfully use, process and transfer the Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement
on the Controller's behalf;</li>
<li>ensure that the relevant third parties have been informed of, and have given their permissions or
consent to, such use, processing, and transfer as required under Data Protection Laws or other
applicable law;</li>
<li>take appropriate Security Measures against unauthorised or unlawful processing of the Personal Data or
its accidental loss, destruction or damage;</li>
<li>not instruct or request the Processor (including in the Controller’s use of the Service) to undertake

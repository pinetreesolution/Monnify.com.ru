<li>
In the performance of its services under this Agreement, a Referrer shall be regarded as having introduced a customer to the platform on the production of a fully completed and endorsed mandate form, a template of which is Annexure 3 to this Agreement.

<div>
<h6>
CONTROLLER
</h6>
<p>
Controller will not provide (or cause to be provided) any Sensitive Data to Processor for processing under the Terms without the express consent of the Data Subject. The Parties understand that Sensitive Data merits specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject.
</p>
<p>
Controller represents and warrants that
</p>
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
it has complied, and will continue to comply, with all applicable laws, including Data Protection Laws, in respect of its processing of Personal Data and any processing instructions it issues to Processor; and
</li>
<li>
it has obtained and will continue to obtain, all consents and rights necessary under Data Protection Laws for Processors to process Personal Data for the purposes described in the Terms.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Controller shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Personal Data and how Controller acquired Personal Data.
</p>
<p>
Controller will ensure that Processor's processing of the Controller's Data following Controller's instructions will not cause Processor to violate any applicable law, regulation, or rule, including, without limitation, Data Protection Laws.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h6>THE PROCESSOR</h6>
<p>
Processor shall adopt such measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the Data transferred to the Processor. These measures include the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data.
</p>
<p>
Processor shall notify Controller in writing within 48 (forty-eight) hours, unless prohibited from doing so under Data Protection Laws, if it becomes aware or believes that any data processing instruction from Controller violates any Data Protection Law.
</p>
<p>Processor shall ensure it can restore the availability and access to Personal Data promptly in the event of a Security Incident. </p>
<p>
Processor shall ensure that any person who is authorised by Processor to process Personal Data (including its staff, agents, and subcontractors) shall be under a contractual or statutory obligation of confidentiality.
</p>
<p>
Processor shall in updating or modifying its Security Measures, ensure that such updates and modifications do not result in the degradation of the Processor’s Security Measures.
</p>
<p>
Upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, Processor shall:
</p>
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
notify Controller without undue delay, and where feasible, in any event no later than 48 hours from becoming aware of the Security Incident.
</li>
<li>
provide timely information relating to the Security Incident as it becomes known or as is reasonably requested by Controller; and
</li>
<li>
promptly take reasonable steps to contain and investigate any Security Incident.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Processor's notification of or response to a Security Incident under clause 2.12 shall not be construed as an acknowledgement by Processor of any fault or liability concerning the Security Incident.
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the above, Controller agrees that except as provided in this Terms, Controller is responsible for protecting the security of Personal Data when in transit to the Processor while the Processor is responsible for protecting the security of Personal Data it receives and transfers to any party including any Sub-Processor.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
SUB-PROCESSING
</h5>
<p>
Controller agrees that the Processor may engage Sub-processors to process Personal Data on Controller's behalf.
</p>
<p>
Processor shall notify Controller of any engagement or disengagement of a Sub-processor.
</p>
<p>Processor shall:
</p>
<ol class="ordered">
<li>
enter a written agreement with each Sub-processor containing data protection obligations that provide at least the same level of protection for Controller’s Data as those in these Terms and Conditions; and
</li>
<li>
remain responsible for the Sub-processor’s compliance with the obligations of this Data Processing Annex and for the acts or omissions of such Sub-processor that cause Processor to breach any of its obligations under this Data Processing Annex.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
SECURITY REPORTS AND AUDITS
</h5>
<p>
Clauses 4.1 and 4.2 shall apply to Processors that are annually audited against PCI Standards and clauses 4.3 and 4.4 shall apply to Processors that are not annually audited against PCI Standards.
</p>
<p>
Processor shall supply (on a confidential basis) a copy of its annual attestation of compliance and certificate of compliance ("Reports") to Controller within five (5) Business Days of Controller’s written
request, to enable Controller verify Processor's compliance with the audit standards against which it has been assessed and this Data Processing Annex.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the Reports, Processor shall respond to all reasonable requests for information made by Controller to confirm Processor's compliance with this Data Processing Annex, including responses to information security, due diligence, and audit questionnaires, by making additional information available regarding its information security program upon Controller’s written request, if Controller shall not exercise this right more than once per calendar year.
</p>
<p>
Where the Processor is not audited against PCI standards, the Processor shall allow for audit inspections by Controller or Controller’s nominated consultant to assess compliance with this Data Processing Annex and Data Protection Laws. Processor shall also make available to Controller all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Data Processing Annex and the Data Protection Laws.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the audit inspections, Processor, shall respond to all reasonable requests for information made by Controller or Controller’s consultant to confirm Processor's compliance with the provisions of this Data Processing Annex, including responses to information security, due diligence, and audit questionnaires, by making additional information available regarding its information security program upon Controller’s or Controller’s consultant written request.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5> INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </h5>
<p>
Controller acknowledges that Processor may transfer and process Personal Data outside of Nigeria where Processor, its Affiliates or its Sub-processors maintain data processing operations. Processor shall always ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
RETURN OR DELETION OF DATA
</h5>
<p>
Upon termination or expiration of the Terms, Processor shall (at Controller's election) delete or return to Controller all Personal Data (including copies) in its possession or control, except that this requirement shall not apply to the extent Processor is required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Personal Data, or the Personal Data is archived on back-up systems, which Personal Data Processor shall securely isolate, protect from any further processing and eventually delete in accordance with Processor's deletion policies, except to the extent required by applicable laws.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5> DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND COOPERATION
</h5>
<p>
Processor shall, considering the nature of the processing, provide reasonable additional assistance to Controller to the extent possible to enable Controller to comply with its data protection obligations with respect to a Data Subject’s rights under Data Protection Laws.
</p>
<p>
</p>If any request is made by a Data Subject to Processor directly, Processor shall not respond to such communication directly except as appropriate (for example, to direct the Data Subject to contact Controller) without Controller's prior authorisation except as legally required.
</p>
<p>
If Processor is required to respond to a request made under clause 7.2, Processor shall promptly notify Controller and provide Controller with a copy of the request unless Processor is legally prohibited from doing so. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Data Processing Annex shall restrict or prevent Processor from responding to any Data Subject or data protection authority requests concerning Personal Data for which Processor is a controller.
</p>
<p>
If a law enforcement agency sends Processor a demand for Personal Data (for example, through a subpoena or court order), Processor shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that Data directly from Controller. As part of this effort, Processor may provide Controller's contact information to the law enforcement agency. If compelled to disclose Personal Data to a law enforcement agency, then Processor shall give Controller reasonable notice of the demand to allow Controller to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedies, unless Processor is legally prohibited from doing so.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
INDEMNIFICATION
</h5>
<p>
The Processor agrees to indemnify, keep indemnified and defend at its own expense the Controller against all costs, claims, damages, or expenses incurred by the Controller or for which the Controller may become liable due to any failure by the Processor or its employees, subcontractors, or agents to comply with any of its obligations under this Data Processing Annex or the Data Protection Legislation.
</p>
<p>
Any limitation of liability provision outlined in the Terms and Conditions shall apply to the indemnity or reimbursement obligations in this Data Processing Annex.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h5>
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TERMS

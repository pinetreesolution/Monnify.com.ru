</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">For more information or to exercise your data protection rights please, please contact our

<p class="pp-list-copy">We will endeavour to process all subject access requests within thirty (30) days and if any

<h1 class="pp-list-header">RETENTION OF YOUR DATA</h1>
<p class="pp-list-copy">We will not retain your personal data for longer than is necessary for the purposes for
which such personal data is processed. This means that your personal data will only be retained for as long as it is
still required to provide you with the Services or is necessary for legal reasons. When calculating the appropriate
retention period of your personal data we consider the nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for
which we are processing such personal data, and any applicable statutory/regulatory retention periods. Using these
criteria, we regularly review the personal data that we hold and the purposes for which such is held and processed.
Our Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCIDSS”) obligation means that we are obliged to retain personal
data for a minimum of ten (10) years from the end date of our business relationship with you. </p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">When we determine that personal data can no longer be retained (or where you request that
we delete your personal data in accordance with your rights contained in the NDPR) we ensure that such personal data
is securely deleted, anonymized or destroyed. However, please note that, in some circumstances we may decide to
retain your personal data as may be reasonably necessary in accordance with the provisions of the NDPR. In such
circumstances, we will anonymize your personal data before retaining same.</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">Please see details of our data retention and disposal process below:
<table class="pp-table">
<tr>
<th>Type of data</th>
<th>Retention Period</th>
<th>Disposal Process</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Electronic storage on database </td>
<td>10 years (regulatory reasons)</td>
<td><i>Programmatic (automatic) process to remove, at least on a quarterly basis, personal data that exceeds
business retention requirements/reviews conducted at least on a quarterly basis</i></td>

</table>
</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">On at least a quarterly basis, we systematically remove and destroy all cardholder data that
has exceeded its retention period, and review and ensure the remaining stored cardholder data remains within the
formal retention requirements. </p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">Wherever the primary account number (“PAN”) is stored, whether electronically or on paper,
it is masked. The first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits that may be displayed. Certain
members of the operations and Service delivery units have a legitimate business need when dealing with
customer/cardholder enquiries to access the PAN. Wherever the PAN is stored (including in logs, removable media,
etc.), it is made unreadable by means of one-way hashes. Cardholder data is never stored on removable media and when
removable physical storage media (including documents, faxes, and electronic media) are no longer required (i.e. they
have passed their retention periods), they are destroyed.

<h1 class="pp-list-header">ACCURACY OF YOUR DATA</h1>
<p class="pp-list-copy">It is important that the personal data Moniepoint Inc holds about you is accurate and current.

<h1 class="pp-list-header">SECURITY OF YOUR DATA</h1>
<p class="pp-list-copy">In order to protect your personal data, we have put in place appropriate organisational
and technical security measures. These measures include storing data on a dedicated and secure server with at least
256-bit encryption, restricting access to your personal data to certain employees, ensuring that our internal
information technology systems are suitably secure, and implementing procedures to deal with any suspected data
breach.</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">In the unlikely event of a data breach, Moniepoint Inc will take steps to mitigate any loss or
destruction of data and, if appropriate, will notify you and any applicable authority of such a breach.</p>
</div>
<div class="pp-list-outer">
<h1 class="pp-list-header">DATA TRANSFERS AND SHARING</h1>
<p class="pp-list-copy">Due to the fact that we operate in a regulated environment, we cannot ensure that all your
private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise
described in this Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose
information to the government, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies, and third parties for the performance of
a task carried out in the interest of the public, for the protection of your vital interest, for the performance of
a contract which you are a party to and also where you have expressly given us written consent to disclose same.</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">We may need to pass your information to third party service providers which maintain,
administer or develop the Sites on our behalf and the information will only be provided for such limited purposes
and as detailed below. Additionally, we may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic
patterns and related website information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will include no personally

<h1 class="pp-list-header">CONFIDENTIALITY</h1>
<p class="pp-list-copy">You further acknowledge that the Sites may contain information which is designated
confidential by us and that you shall not disclose such information without our prior written consent. Your
information is regarded as confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party, unless if legally
required to do so to the appropriate authorities. We will not sell, share, or rent your personal data to any third
party nor use your email address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by us will only be in connection with the
provision of agreed Services.</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">We take all necessary precautions to protect your personal information both online and
off-line. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password, your mobile phone or
computer. Be sure to log off from the Sites when you are using a shared phone/computer. We also protect your
personal data off-line. Access to your personal data is limited to employees, agents or partners and third parties
with whom we are working who we reasonably believe will need that information to provide the Services to you.</p>

<div class="pp-list-outer">
<h1 class="pp-list-header">COOKIES</h1>
<p class="pp-list-copy">We use data collection devices such as ‘cookies’ on certain pages of the Sites. Cookies
are small files stored on your hard drive that assist us in providing Services customised to your requirements and
tastes. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a ‘cookie’. Cookies can also help
us provide information, which is targeted to your interests. Cookies may be used whether you choose to register with
Us or not.</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session.
Most cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a
session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be
able to use certain features on the Sites and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a
session. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Use of a cookie
is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Sites. Once you close your browser, the
cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on your browser, you would not have to log in a password
more than once, thereby saving time while on the Sites.</p>
<p class="pp-list-copy">You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can
reset your browser to refuse all cookies or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you
reject the cookies on the Sites, you may still be able to use the Sites, but it shall be limited to certain minimal
functionality. The only drawback to this is that you may be limited to some areas of Sites or limited to certain
functions of the Sites.</p>
